# Lab 6

** For this lab, you will be tasked with creating an engaging and creative React-based Portfolio site using, in addition
to your React skills, your knowledge of HTML5, CSS and styling frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap), and advanced
JavaScript. This lab is the first of a set of three connected deliverables (i.e., Lab 6, Lab 7, and Lab 8), which
means you will be adding some features and functionality from one lab to the next.

## Testing

**Backend Testing:

The backend functionality has been tested for the appropriate rendering of content in the portfolio.
The applicationâ€™s React components were tested for correct output using Jest and React Testing Library.


Error Handling: Some edge cases, such as partial network failures, were challenging to handle. These were mitigated by providing clear error messages and retry mechanisms.
