          <strong>Project 1: Music Discovery App</strong>
          <p>
            A web application that allows users to discover new music based on their preferences. Users can search for songs, create playlists, and share their favorite tracks. I developed the frontend using React and integrated the app with an external API to fetch song data. My role in this project was to design the user interface, implement the search and playlist features, and ensure a smooth user experience.

          <p>
            This mobile app helps users quickly calculate their finances and track their spending habits. It includes features such as expense tracking, budget setting, and financial goal monitoring. For this project, I worked with Java and MySQL for the backend, while also focusing on building a clean, intuitive user interface using Android Studio. I collaborated with a team to ensure the app met the user needs and provided value.

          <p>
            This web-based tool was designed to help students at Dalhousie University manage their budgets more effectively. As part of a team, I helped design and develop a user-friendly interface where students could input their monthly expenses and income, and the calculator would generate a personalized budget plan. I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and user testing to ensure the tool was functional and accessible to all users.

            This is the website you are currently browsing! It was built to showcase my skills, experience, and projects in an interactive and visually appealing way. I used HTML, CSS, and React to create a responsive design that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. This project allowed me to experiment with different design concepts while practicing my web development skills.
